# Full-Stack Job Listing Website

This repository contains the full-stack implementation of a job listing website built with Django REST Framework, Scrapy, and ReactJS/NextJS with Tailwind CSS.

## Description

The job listing website fetches job data from a MySQL database via a Django REST API. The frontend displays the job listings in a user-friendly and structured manner, and the scraper collects job data from an external website and sends it to the backend for storage in the database.

## Screenshots

Below are screenshots of the user interface:
